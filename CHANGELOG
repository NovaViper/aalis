KEY:
+ = addition
- = removal
* = bugfix
^ = enhancement/change

Version 3.2.1
- No longer allow zshrc to be placed in /etc/zsh, would will allow for custom zshrc files for each user (including root)
^ Will skip premade settings prompts if you want to import the ones from your dotfiles repo
^ Finally replaced ZPLUG_HOME with ZINIT_HOME

Version 3.2.0
+ Script now asks if you want to download DE specific AUR packages
+ Added GTK2 and GTK xdg configuration
+ Added yadm dotfile configuration importer, now asks if you want to import your dotfiles
+ Added BOOT_DIR variable for esp/boot partition location.. might be useful if I can figure out why LUKS+GRUB caused issues with /efi partition
* Fixed issue where yadm was having corrupted PGP errors
- Removed the ability to use the /efi partition, which fixed a critical issue where system wouldn't boot because of the /efi partition with LUKS.. unsure as to why it's not working, but until I can pin down the issue, the script will no longer use /efi but will instead use what it was using before, the /boot partition
^ Script can now automatically enable the Dracula theme for KDE
^ More error handling for root password creation and normal user creation
^ Normal user accounts can now make usernames that contain 'root' in them (not still can't create an account called root)
^ Changed some parameter names to make it easier to read them in the source code
^ Moved ZSH and VIM premade configurations, and template of user_pkglist.txt over to premade-configs folder

* Fixed critical typo that resulted in cryptroot UUID not being properly passed to the end

+ Added some more packages in user_pkglist.txt.example (for my own usage)
+ Added some more KDE specific packages that were originally missing into list of KDE packages to be installed
* Fixed bug where comment instance of en_US,UTF-8 UTF-8 was being uncommented (hence broke the locale generation)

* Fixed critical bug where grub-mkconfig would install in the wrong path

^ Tabify all lines!
^ Used Heredoc EOFs for multiline echos
^ YesNo questions now have the color variable set in the beginning of the function (so now it's askYesNo $COLOR $STRING and can be askYesNo $STRING)
^ Script now looks for beta build versions with 'rc' instead of just 'r'
^ Script now uses GitLab's Releases API to retrieve latest version and beta versions (if using a beta build)
^ Version Checker now asks if you want to continue
^ Made EFI partition smaller
^ Systemd-boot menu now only works for UEFI and not BIOS
^ UEFI ESP partition is under /efi, which expands bootloader compatibility and fix any other pitfalls of using /boot on UEFI systems
^ The script will accordingly install the ESP partition depending on firmware type (BIOS will still use /boot while UEFI will use /efi)
^ Made core install variables more readable, skipped to v3.1.0 due to such a crucial change
^ Script now checks if sysconfig.conf file is present after first two stages (pre-install and setup)
